						<h3>Diamond Education Guide</h3>
						<p>Overwhelmed as you start looking at engagement rings, it can seem that way. It's actually something very simple and extremely helpful - Cut, Color, Clarity, Carat Weight. Here's everything you need to know when shopping for the engagement ring. There are rings, and there is THE RING. Let us help you find the perfect one.</p>

						<p>The 4C’s</p>

						<p>The cut of a diamond affects how well a diamond returns light back to the viewer's eye, resulting in what we call fire, sparkle or brilliance.
						A well cut diamond will appear brilliant and fiery, while a poorly cut diamond may appear dark or lifeless regardless of how good the color or clarity may be. Not only do well cut diamonds have the most sparkle they may also appear larger than a poorly cut diamond of the same carat weight.
						The American Gem Society (AGS) has a scale to measure the quality of a diamond cut, ranging from 0 (ideal) to 10 (poor).</p>

						<h4>Good Proportions</h4>
						<p>When a diamond is cut to good proportions, light reflects from one facet to another, then reflects back through the top of the diamond.</p>
						<h4>Too Shallow</h4>
						<p>If the cut is too shallow, light escapes through the bottom of the stone before it can be reflected, thus reducing its brilliance.</p>
						<h4>Too Deep</h4>
						<p>If the cut of the diamond is too deep, some light escapes through the side of the stone.</p>

										



						<p>The pattern of surfaces (or facets) you see on a diamond represents the quality of the cut and has a direct effect on the overall sparkle of the stone. When a diamond is cut to good proportions, light reflects from one facet to another, then reflects back through the top of the diamond. If the cut of a diamond is too deep, some light escapes through the side of the stone. If the cut is too shallow, light escapes through the bottom of the stone before it can be reflected, thus reducing its brilliance.</p>

						<p>A diamond's color is a measure of the stone's whiteness, meaning it is actually measuring the lack of color a diamond has.</p>
						<p>The American Gem Society (AGS) has a scale to measure a diamond's color, ranging from 0.0 (colorless) to 10 (light).</p>

						<img src="<?php echo  base_url()?>assets/img/aboutus/diamond_guide/4.jpg" />

						<h4>D,E,F - Colorless</h4>
						<p>The rarest and most valuable diamonds, these diamonds will exhibit virtually no color when viewed by a gemologist.</p>
						<h4>G,H,I,J - Near colorless</h4>
						<p>These appear to be colorless when viewed face up by a gemologist, but will display a slight amount of color when viewed face down on a pure white background. This slight amount of color is generally not detectable to an untrained eye, especially after it has been set into a piece of jewlery.</p>
						<h4>K,L,M - Faint</h4>
						<p>Diamonds in the K-M range generally have a very faint yellow tone to them, but well cut diamonds will still contain the brilliance and fire that make them beautiful and unique.</p>
						<h4>N,O,P,Q,R - Very Light</h4>
						<p>Diamonds in the N-R range generally have a very light yellow tone to them.</p>
						<h4>S,T,U,V,W,X - Light</h4>
						<p>Diamonds in the S-Z range generally have a yellow tone to them.</p>
						
						<p>For most people, the difference between colorless, near colorless, and even the highest range of faint yellow diamonds can be hard to see. It's actually possible for a diamond to go above a "10" color, but at that point the diamond is re-categorized as a "Fancy Color Diamond." These extremely rare diamonds exhibit intense colors such as blue, pink, yellow green or even red and have their own set of grading parameters.</p>

						<p>The clarity of a diamond refers to the presence (or lack) of imperfections.</p>
						<p>Generally, the more imperfections (or inclusions) a diamond has, the lower the clarity. But number of inclusions is not the only measure of diamond clarity. Other inclusion factors that affect clarity include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Size - How large the inclusion is.</li>
							<li>Number - How many inclusions are present</li>
							<li>Position - Where the inclusion is located. For instance, it may be more hidden in the inside lower facets, or more      obvious on the surface of the diamond.</li>
							<li>Nature - Based on their size and location some inclusions may affect the durability of the diamond.</li>
							<li>Relief - Based on color, some inclusions may be more apparent than others. For example black inclusions are much more visible than white or clear inclusions.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The American Gem Society (AGS) has a scale to measure diamond clarity, ranging from 0 (flawless) to 10 (included).</p>
						<img src="<?php echo  base_url()?>assets/img/aboutus/diamond_guide/6.jpg" />

						<h4>FL, IF</h4>
						<p>Flawless - No inclusions or surface blemishes under 10X magnification. Internally flawless - No inclusions under 10X magnification; either no surface blemishes, or insignificant surface blemishes that can be removed with minor polishing.</p>
						<h4>VVS1, VVS2</h4>
						<p>Very, very slightly included - Diamonds will have minor inclusion or blemishes that are difficult for even a trained gemologist to see.</p>
						<h4>VS1, VS2</h4>
						<p>Very slightly included - Minor inclusions or blemishes that are generally not visible to the naked eye. These inclusions are somewhat difficult to see with a trained eye and would be very difficult to see with an untrained eye under 10X magnification.</p>
						<h4>SI1, SI2</h4>
						<p>Slightly included - Inclusions that are easy for a trained eye to see under 10X magnification. These inclusions may be visible to the naked eye, although they are generally difficult to see with an untrained eye in stones under 1ct.</p>
						<h4>I1, I2, I3</h4>
						<p>Included - Inclusions that are very easy for a trained eye to see under 10X magnification. These inclusions are often visible to the naked eye and in the case of I3 diamonds the inclusions may affect the structural integrity of the stone as well as impacting its brilliance.</p>

						   <p>A carat specifically measures a diamond's weight.  </p>   
							<p>A carat equals 0.2 grams. Carats are then divided into 100 points. So a quarter-carat has 25 points and is written as 0.25 carats, or ¼ carat. Because of its rarity, one larger diamond is more valuable than a combination of smaller diamonds.  </p>    
							<p>As you can see from the comparison tool below, a 2 carat diamond does not necessarily look twice as big as a 1 carat diamond does from the top. That's because other factors such as the cut and table size of the diamond also have a significant effect on the apparent size of a diamond. </p>

						  <p> The shape of a diamond refers to its overall form (round, princess, pear, etc.)     
							A diamond's shape is its most basic characteristic, and one that most people can identify on first glance.      </p>

						<h4>Round</h4>
						<p>A round brilliant cut stone is the most popular shape available. The cut maximizes fire and brilliance.</p>
										
						<img src="<?php echo  base_url()?>assets/img/aboutus/diamond_guide/10.jpg" />
						<h4>Princess</h4>
						<p>A stone cut into a square or rectangular shape with pointed corners that has brilliant style cutting on the crown and pavilion facets.</p>
									
									
																					   
									
													 
									
																	  
									
																	  
									
						<img src="<?php echo  base_url()?>assets/img/aboutus/diamond_guide/11.jpg" />				

						<h4>Cushion</h4>
						<p>A cushion cut combines a square cut with rounded corners letting the diamond return light in a chunkier pattern than more modern cuts.</p>
										
						<img src="<?php echo  base_url()?>assets/img/aboutus/diamond_guide/12.jpg" />
						<h4>Emerald</h4>
						<p>A rectangular or square cut that features step cuts. the stone’s larger facets are cut like steps that create a mirrored effect that looks like a staircase.</p>
									
									
																					   
									
													 
									
																	  
									
																	  
						<img src="<?php echo  base_url()?>assets/img/aboutus/diamond_guide/13.jpg" />			
										

						<h4>Oval</h4>
						<p>A stone cut into an elongated circle. This cut has similar brilliance to a round diamond and accentuates long, slender fingers.</p>
										
						<img src="<?php echo  base_url()?>assets/img/aboutus/diamond_guide/14.jpg" />
						<h4>Radiant</h4>
						<p>A square stone cut to have a complete brilliant-cut facet pattern applied to both the crown and pavilion.</p>
									
									
																					   
									
													 
									
																	  
									
																	  
									
										
						<img src="<?php echo  base_url()?>assets/img/aboutus/diamond_guide/15.jpg" />
						<h4>Pear</h4>
						<p>A pear stone cut is also called a teardrop with a single point and rounded end. This shape can create a slimming effect on the fingers.</p>
										
						<img src="<?php echo  base_url()?>assets/img/aboutus/diamond_guide/16.jpg" />
						<h4>Heart</h4>
						<p>A heart shape is the universal symbol of love. look for stones where the top arches are even, the stone is symmetrical and the cleft is clearly defined.</p>
									
									
																					   
									
													 
									
																	  
									
																	  
												
						<img src="<?php echo  base_url()?>assets/img/aboutus/diamond_guide/17.jpg" />				

						<h4>Marquise</h4>
						<p>A fancy gemstone cut; long and pointed at both ends. This cut can maximize the carat weight, making the stone appear larger.</p>
										
						<img src="<?php echo  base_url()?>assets/img/aboutus/diamond_guide/18.jpg" />
						<h4>Asscher</h4>
						<p>A stone cut similar to a square emerald cut, usually with larger step facets, a higher crown, and a smaller table.</p>
