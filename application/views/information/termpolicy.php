						<H3>BUY-BACK PROGRAM</H3>
						<p>The Buy-back program is a facility offered at Maisya to ensure customer satisfaction. This Buy-back Program is a program where customers can resell jewelry purchased at Maisya at 30% discount. The buy-back program also applies if the customer wants to replace the jewelry. Please read the applicable buy-back policy if you wish to sell or replace your jewelry in Maisya.</p>
						<H3>POLICY BUY-BACK</H3>
						<p>Here are the terms and conditions of the buy-back program that must be considered before you resell or change your jewelry in Maisya:</p>
						<p>● Maisya does not accept the sale of jewelry with special symbols, for example: name or initials.</p>
						<p>● The process of reselling or replacing jewelry can be done at our nearest store (information store, please check here)</p>
						<p>● The price of jewelry to be paid by Maisya is 70% of the initial purchase price, provided that the product is not damaged or defective, and has an official certificate</p>
						<p>● Maisya does not accept product cancellations for the reason of 'change of mind'. If you would like to replace the jewelry you ordered, please contact our Customer Agent Representative at +62 815-1433-1660 or email to support@Maisya.com (buy-back policy will apply).</p>
						<p>● If the jewelry to be resold is damaged or defective, then the resale price will be lower. The more the number of defects found in your jewelry, the selling price will decrease.</p>
						<p>● If you want to resell the purchased jewelry, then want to replace it with a new one, then the money you will receive or pay depends on the price of the new jewelry.</p>
						<H3>Here's a quick illustration of resale and jewelry replacement:</H3>
						<p>Dewi bought a diamond ring in Maisya online on July 2, 2017 for Rp 25.000.000. Then after one year's wearing, Dewi wants to sell back on July 2, 2018. So, he can immediately come to the nearest store Maisya to resell the jewelry he bought with an official certificate of jewelry. </p>

						<p>The total money to be received by Dewi is worth IDR 17.500.000 (70% of the initial purchase price, if the jewelry is not damaged or defective). However, if found some damage to the jewelry to be sold, then the sale price is less than IDR 17.500.000 (tota money paid depends on the lot and type of damage or disability). </p>
						<p>After getting the sale price, Dewi intends to buy new jewelry, a pendant for example for 18 million, then Dewi only need to pay the shortage of money only.
						<H3>So the total price Dewi pays is:</H3>
						<p>The remaining money paid </p>
						<p>: = Liontin price - Ring Selling Price </p>
						<p>: = 17.500.000 - 5.000.000 </p>
						<p>: = IDR 500.000 - </p>
						<H3>However, if Dewi only wanted to buy a ring for 5,000,000, then the rest of the money Dewi received was:</H3>
						<p>The remaining money received </p>
						<p>: = Selling Price Ring - New Ring Price </p>
						<p>: = Liontin price - Ring Selling Price </p>
						<p>: = IDR 500.000 - </p>
